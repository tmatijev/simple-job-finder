I want to create a google chrome extension that will search for the jobs but via google search. For example, this is how you can search for a job:

site:jobs.lever.co OR apply.workable.com OR bamboohr.com OR crew.work OR boards.greenhouse.io OR gr8people.com OR homreun.co OR jobs.ashbyhq.com OR myworkdayjobs.com OR pinpointhq.com OR careers.smartrecruiters.com OR hire.trakstar.com OR turbohire.co OR recruit.juucy.io OR app.dover.com entirely OR fully OR worldwide OR first OR "from anywhere" engineer OR developer remote OR remotely js OR "javascript" OR "typescript" OR "frontend" OR "front-end"

This is how each query search will look alike and it will open in a new tab window. There will be no special filters but some of those are important such as:

- Is it remote, hybrind or a job on location
- Frontend, backend, qa, designer, etc.
- Location (Europe, USA, NA, SA, Asia, etc.) but if it's remote, it does not matter
- Can we know if there is a salary in the job or not? If not, do not do it

Technologies:

- Use React, as the Tailwind for the CSS
- Create modern and simple design
- React use only functional components, not classes
